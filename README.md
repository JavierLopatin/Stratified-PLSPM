## Repository with an example of PLS-PM structural equation modeling with stratified bootstrapping

### Models for the paper:
### *'Environmental changes produce different responses on ecosystem water use efficiency in an old-growth temperate rainforest and an anthropogenic peatland'*
### yet to be submitted

### Models include the prediction of Gross Primary Production (GPP), Evapotranspiration (ET), Water Use Efficiency (WUE), Inherent Water use Efficiency (IWUE), and Intrinsic Water use Efficiency (iWUE) for a Template Rain Forest (TRF) and a Peatland (AP) of Chilean Patagonia.

### The climatic drivers included as predictors are: solar radiation (Rg), air temperature (Ta), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), wind speed (U), precipitation (P), soil water content (SWC), water table depth (WTD), and surface conductance (GS).

### All data was obtained from Eddy Flux towers with monthly intervals between 2014 and 2017.

### Model structures are the following:
